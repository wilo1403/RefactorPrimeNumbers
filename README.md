# RefactorPrimeNumbers
==========

--------------------
+ I adjusted the name of the variables to be more descriptive and under the standard of java
--------------------

+ I initialized some variables at declaration time to optimize the code
--------------------

+ I optimized the code that determines the prime numbers
--------------------

+ I create the Prime class with the IsPrime method that easily determines if a number is prime
--------------------

+ In the main class only I left the functionality of generating columns, rows and the pagination of the prime numbers obtained from the Prime class
--------------------

+ I Implement comments for clearer source code
--------------------
